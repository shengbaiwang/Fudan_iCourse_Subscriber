"""Shard the SQLite database into encrypted chunks for incremental fetch.

WHY SHARD
=========
Once the DB grows past ~50MB the frontend pays a long re-download tax for
every commit, even if only one course changed.  Sharding by course lets the
frontend hold a content-addressed cache (sha256 → bytes) and re-pull only
the shards whose hash actually changed, which collapses the typical update
to <1MB on the wire.

WHY *PERSISTENT SLOT ASSIGNMENT* (PSA), NOT HASH-MOD
====================================================
An earlier version used ``int(course_id) % num_shards``.  That had two
structural problems that broke the cache-locality goal of sharding itself:

  1. *Volatile and stable courses were spread evenly across all shards*.
     The user's currently-subscribed (volatile) courses and their long
     tail of historical / single-run (stable) courses were interleaved
     by hash.  Every routine run produced new bytes for at least one
     subscribed course, which dirtied at least one course per shard
     on average → roughly every shard changed → cache invalidated.

  2. *Shard count depended on ceil(N_courses / 15)*.  Whenever
     ``N_courses`` crossed a 15-multiple — a new course discovered by
     single-run, or a course removed — ``num_shards`` ticked and
     ``cid % num_shards`` reassigned EVERY course in one go.  A single
     unrelated event triggered a full global reshuffle.

Cache-locality requires three properties simultaneously:

    (a) Volatile courses cluster together so a routine run only dirties
        a small known set of shards.
    (b) Stable courses cluster separately so their shards never change
        after the single event that first wrote them.
    (c) No event — adding a course, growing a bin past its pack size,
        crossing any threshold — ever triggers a global reassignment.

PSA delivers all three by persisting each course's ``(bin, shard_idx)``
slot in the ``meta`` table and reusing it across runs:

    - ``hot`` bin   = courses in the current subscription list.
    - ``cold`` bin  = everything else (single-run residue, unsubscribed
                      historic courses, etc.).
    - Each course's slot is sticky.  A course only moves when its bin
      changes (subscribe / unsubscribe an existing-in-DB course), which
      is rare — by far the most common subscription change is "+1 new
      course" which has never been in the DB and goes straight to hot.
    - New courses go to the lowest non-full shard in their bin; if all
      shards in that bin are full, the lowest unused index opens a
      fresh shard.  Opening a fresh shard does NOT renumber any
      existing one.

The full event matrix:

    +-----------------------------------+-------------------+----------+
    | event                             | shards dirtied    | reshuffle|
    +-----------------------------------+-------------------+----------+
    | routine run: hot course produces  |        1 (hot)    |    no    |
    |     new lecture / new summary     |                   |          |
    | single-run on brand-new course    |        1 (cold)   |    no    |
    | single-run on existing cold course|        1 (cold)   |    no    |
    | subscribe brand-new course        |        1 (hot)    |    no    |
    |     (the common case — course is  |                   |          |
    |     not yet in the DB)            |                   |          |
    | subscribe existing-cold course    |    2 (1H + 1C)    |    no    |
    | unsubscribe (rare)                |    2 (1H + 1C)    |    no    |
    | hot bin needs new shard           |        1 (hot)    |    no    |
    | cold bin needs new shard          |        1 (cold)   |    no    |
    | "global reshuffle"                |        0          |   never  |
    +-----------------------------------+-------------------+----------+

SUBSCRIPTION SOURCE
===================
The sharder needs to know which courses are currently in the subscription
list (= hot bin), without modifying any other module of the codebase.

The strategy:

    1. Env var ``SUBSCRIBED_COURSE_IDS`` — when set, it is authoritative
       and is persisted to ``meta('subscribed_course_ids')``.  This is
       set only in ``check.yml``'s shard step, where the workflow knows
       the full subscription (the GitHub Actions secret).

    2. Otherwise — read the previously persisted value from
       ``meta('subscribed_course_ids')``.  ``single_run.yml``,
       ``delete_course.yml``, and manual reshards take this path; they
       would otherwise be at risk of treating their one-shot
       ``COURSE_IDS`` input as the full subscription and corrupting the
       bin layout.

LAYOUT under ``output_dir``
===========================
    icourse-index.enc                — encrypted JSON index (small,
                                       always re-fetched)
    shards/meta-0000.db.gz.enc       — meta + all_courses catalog
    shards/shard-hot-NNNN.db.gz.enc  — hot bin (≤10 courses each)
    shards/shard-cold-NNNN.db.gz.enc — cold bin (≤30 courses each)

Trust model: every shard and the index are encrypted with the v2 password
(sha256("ICSv2:" + stuid + ":" + uispsw)).  The data branch is public; the
file names and shard count leak, but no row content does.
